Star Ship game. (Space invaders like)<br>
In December and January, when I was in university vacation. I develop this project, which I called if, very informal as project vacation I.<br>
I use godot and GDScript to make it possible.<br>
The game is very simple, you are a star ship, you can only move to left and right, it shot automatically.<br>
I know that I can improve the project, putting more enemys, new guns and maybe a boss fight.<br>
To make the sprites I used Pixel Studio, it is free on steam, and also I was hepd by <a href="https://github.com/ValberGusmao">ValberGusmao</a><br>
to make the sprits and he gave me a few ideas.<br>
The version of gotod was 4.1<br>
If you want to improve it please fell free to download it and text to me in <a href="http://discordapp.com/users/809008002346516480">My discord</a>
